  有时候我们使用git  push向远程仓库推送的时候，会报错如下：
  remote rejected] master -> master (branch is currently checked out)
remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master
remote: error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
remote: error: is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
remote: error: with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match
remote: error: the work tree to HEAD.
remote: error:
remote: error: You can set 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to
remote: error: 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
remote: error: its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you
remote: error: arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
remote: error: other way.
remote: error:
remote: error: To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set
remote: error: 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to 'refuse'.
To git@192.168.1.X:/var/git.server/.../web
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (branch is currently checked out)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@192.168.1.X:/var/git.server/.../web'

 这是因为git默认是拒绝push操作的，我们在.git/config里面添加如下配置项即可：
 
 [receive]
    denyCurrentBranch = ignore
